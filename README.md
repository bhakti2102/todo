# Todo Application
This is a Todo application built with a front-end using React, JavaScript, CSS, Redux, and Redux Observable, and a back-end using Java and Spring Boot. It utilizes a MySQL database to store user-specific tasks. The application provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing tasks and features a login and signup system for individual user task management.

Features
User Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to manage their own tasks securely.

Create: Add new tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates.

Read: View a list of tasks, filterable by status or due date. Tasks are categorized by the user who created them.

Update: Modify existing tasks by changing their titles, descriptions, due dates, or status.

Delete: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.

Technologies Used
Front-end
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

JavaScript: The primary programming language for adding interactivity to the application.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the user interface.

Redux: A predictable state container for managing the application's state.

Redux Observable: Middleware for handling asynchronous operations, such as API requests and responses.

Back-end
Java: The programming language used for building the server-side logic.

Spring Boot: A framework for building Java-based web applications quickly and easily.

MySQL Database: A relational database used for storing user data and task information.
